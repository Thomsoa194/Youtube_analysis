YOUTUBE analysis

In this project I asked the following questions about a dataset sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new

The analysis looked at only videos from Great Britain and asked the following questions:

1. According to this dataset, which channel has the most trending videos?
2. Which time of the day are trending videos most likely to be published?
3. Can a video's number of likes be predicted from the number of views and number of comments using Multiple Linear Regression?

This project was particulary of interest to me since I have loved YouTube since I was 14 years old and so uncovering insights into the trending videos was of particular interest. 

For question 3 I use Multiple Linear Regression. The libraries I used were Seaborn and Matplotlib.
